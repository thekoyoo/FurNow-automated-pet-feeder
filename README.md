Hi everyone! Thanks for using this tutorial!

All of the code is open for you to edit however I don't recommend editing the RTC adjustment code unless you know what you're doing.
For people on this repo who don't know what this is for, check out @fur.now_feline.shelter on TikTok and Instagram!!!

Have fun!
